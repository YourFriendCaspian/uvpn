# uvpn
*a quick way to setup secure openvpn with easy-rsa on Ubuntu*

Clone or download, and configure the options in `vars` then run `build-server` 
as root. The packages openvpn and easy-rsa will be downloaded if missing, 
server-side certificates generated and the server configured. 
Client configuration files (.ovpn) can then easily be generated by running 
`build-ovpn CLIENTNAME` as root.
