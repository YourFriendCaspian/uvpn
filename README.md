# uVPN
*a quick way to setup secure OpenVPN with easy-rsa on Ubuntu*

Clone or download, configure the options in `vars` then run `build-server` 
as root. The packages openvpn and easy-rsa and dependencies will be downloaded 
if missing, then server-side certificates generated and the server configured. 
Client configuration files (.ovpn) can then easily be generated by running 
`build-ovpn CLIENTNAME` as root.
